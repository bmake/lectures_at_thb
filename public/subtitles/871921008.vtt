Hello, and welcome to the lecture on Spark ql,

1
00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:07.750
the R D F Query language. Um,

2
00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:13.230
this lecture is based on b Sharon's book, A Learning Spark,

3
00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:17.870
ql, which I can suggest everybody who want to learn sparkle. Uh,

4
00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:21.670
but the lecture is very much applied,

5
00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:26.280
applied to a specific knowledge graph, uh, which, uh,

6
00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:31.240
we called it catalog because it is mainly about IT

7
00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:36.560
services in an organization. Now, lectures, again,

8
00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:38.760
divided in several tasks.

9
00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:43.680
And let's start with introducing our application domain,

10
00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:48.920
the, uh, IT catalog knowledge graph, our application.

11
00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.760
Um, when we decided to, uh,

12
00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.600
build such a knowledge graph based application,

13
00:00:56.740 --> 00:01:01.360
we had the situation that at that the university's IT

14
00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:06.480
services are provided by a variety of internal and external

15
00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:10.080
providers, and the information about the access,

16
00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:15.000
the descriptions of the services, the support levels, and so on,

17
00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:18.680
they are distributed across different media.

18
00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:23.760
So end users lack orientation and sometimes could not find the,

19
00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:25.880
uh, necessary information.

20
00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:29.480
And we thought it might be a good idea to have a solution,

21
00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:32.800
which is a user friendly access platform,

22
00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:37.680
which consolidates all information on the organization's IT services.

23
00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:42.520
So end users, um, have a single point of contact.

24
00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:47.440
And the idea was because it was a prototypical project,

25
00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:51.240
it was not, uh, going productive at the university.

26
00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:56.600
So the idea was that the data might be annotated downstream by the

27
00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:01.440
providers. So, uh, when something is changing the data,

28
00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:06.320
they can it do easily. And then, uh, they use for that,

29
00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:10.960
uh, our knowledge graphs, schema, and the application.

30
00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:16.600
Um, the application becomes, uh,

31
00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:21.280
really, uh, up to time every time. So this was a kind of, um,

32
00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:25.080
prototypical development and idea, but nevertheless,

33
00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:28.840
we built the application and the application is, um,

34
00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:33.600
really nice and we can use it as an application

35
00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:36.320
case, as a use case for, um,

36
00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:39.720
demonstrating the power of, uh,

37
00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:44.240
sparkle and also demonstrating the power of knowledge graph based

38
00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:49.260
structures. So before we, uh,

39
00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:53.820
will have a look on the application itself, I want to introduce,

40
00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:58.740
uh, the knowledge schema of that application for modeling

41
00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:04.080
this. Um, yeah, this graph, I did not use the,

42
00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:08.960
um, the concept mapping tool. I did it with, uh,

43
00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:12.080
let's say, um, basic tools,

44
00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:16.200
which also are provided by, um, PowerPoint.

45
00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:20.960
So, um, first let's, um,

46
00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:26.080
explain the color coding. You see here used, um,

47
00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:29.200
four or even five different colors,

48
00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:35.000
all elements which are in red color. So it's, uh, the notes,

49
00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.800
service role, quality value organization and person.

50
00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:42.560
They are based on schema org.

51
00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:47.520
And the same applies to the relation, which are in red collar schema.

52
00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:52.400
Agent schema is related to schema member and schema employee.

53
00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:56.360
Um, then we have, uh,

54
00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:01.160
two yellow nodes agent and entity. They stem from,

55
00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:05.920
uh, also a standard vocabulary which was provided,

56
00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:10.960
uh, before schema exists. This are really, uh,

57
00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:13.280
let's, uh, call it, um,

58
00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:18.320
main categories, which we, uh, which we, um,

59
00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:22.600
brought from this, this, uh, vocabulary,

60
00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:27.320
but we only used this, uh, two notes, no, um,

61
00:04:27.650 --> 00:04:31.960
properties or no attributes from that vocabulary.

62
00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:38.120
Um, from another vocabulary, which is, you can say a little bit,

63
00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:41.040
uh, ancient or, or, uh, the, uh,

64
00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:46.120
the oldest one of what we use is fav, um,

65
00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:48.880
is deciphered as friend of a friend.

66
00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:53.480
So this was one of the basic vocabularies when web semantics starts.

67
00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:58.800
Um, this was a vocabulary to support, um,

68
00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:03.720
annotating of so-called social graphs. Yeah, you can, um,

69
00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:07.120
you can model, um,

70
00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:10.960
person in their relations and their, uh,

71
00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:14.440
contact data and also, uh,

72
00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:18.920
some documents which they, um, provide, for instance,

73
00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:24.040
a CV or things like that. Uh, when I, um, would model,

74
00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:28.360
um, such, uh, schema today, um,

75
00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:33.440
I really would not use a four page document because in

76
00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:37.840
schema.org we have, uh, similar notes, similar classes,

77
00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:42.800
but this is, as I told you, um, not built today.

78
00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:47.440
It was built, um, I think, uh, eight or nine years ago.

79
00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:52.720
And it's basically, um, in the same way, uh,

80
00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:55.840
therefore I didn't change the schema.

81
00:05:56.820 --> 00:06:00.330
And then we have this, uh, green boxes, the green notes,

82
00:06:00.750 --> 00:06:04.530
and these are proprietary or customary notes,

83
00:06:04.820 --> 00:06:08.930
which we could not take from, um, existing vocabulary,

84
00:06:09.030 --> 00:06:13.570
and therefore we have to define, we have to declare them theirselves.

85
00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:18.490
Um, here you can see the IT assets, uh,

86
00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:23.570
which are a subclass of entity, and you can see the service categories,

87
00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:28.690
lifecycle stages, um, and such aspects of, uh,

88
00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:32.530
services as priority and criticality.

89
00:06:34.630 --> 00:06:35.463
Um,

90
00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:41.380
you can see here some arrows with an empty

91
00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:44.420
triangle arrow head, uh,

92
00:06:44.670 --> 00:06:49.340
which you might know for instance from a U M L, um,

93
00:06:49.590 --> 00:06:54.460
class diagrams. And this arrows mean here,

94
00:06:54.940 --> 00:06:57.260
subclass of, yeah. So, uh,

95
00:06:57.560 --> 00:07:02.100
the role is a subclass of a agent and also organization

96
00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:06.220
are subclass of agents and person are subclass of agents,

97
00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:10.140
and you have the same, uh, for service category.

98
00:07:10.310 --> 00:07:15.060
There you have the subclasses catalog category, subject category,

99
00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:19.300
and lifecycle stages. All other, um,

100
00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:24.580
arrows or all other edges, they are labeled with, um,

101
00:07:24.870 --> 00:07:29.500
their, uh, semantic, um, with their, uh,

102
00:07:29.530 --> 00:07:32.820
according property. Um,

103
00:07:33.710 --> 00:07:38.460
these are in this case all relations. Okay. And then,

104
00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:41.100
uh, the last we have, um,

105
00:07:41.350 --> 00:07:46.060
these gray boxes and the gray boxes represent, uh,

106
00:07:46.060 --> 00:07:48.780
named individuals. So in

107
00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:53.540
all service categories, uh,

108
00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:55.820
in these both types of service categories,

109
00:07:55.820 --> 00:08:00.020
the catalog category and the subject category, we have, um,

110
00:08:00.330 --> 00:08:02.980
different types of category and they,

111
00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:07.580
we understand as a named individuals business, um,

112
00:08:08.740 --> 00:08:12.540
business, uh, catalog. We have an infrastructure catalog, an operational,

113
00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:16.700
and a public catalog. And the same we used for, uh,

114
00:08:16.700 --> 00:08:21.020
the priority and the criticality. Um, I didn't it, um,

115
00:08:21.830 --> 00:08:22.820
specialize in,

116
00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:27.740
in the model because the model would become a little

117
00:08:27.760 --> 00:08:32.660
bit, uh, overwhelming and, uh, for priority and criticality.

118
00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:36.590
The instantiations, uh,

119
00:08:36.690 --> 00:08:41.110
are a kind of standard based, yes, you have low priority,

120
00:08:41.110 --> 00:08:44.950
middle priority, and high priority, and the same to criticality.

121
00:08:45.610 --> 00:08:50.030
So this is the schema, um, which lays, uh,

122
00:08:50.130 --> 00:08:54.430
as a foundation of our knowledge graph and also for the application.

123
00:08:56.780 --> 00:09:00.400
So some words do the, uh, architecture of the, um,

124
00:09:00.740 --> 00:09:04.880
it cut application is a three tier app, um,

125
00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:10.000
architecture. Uh, at the base you has the, uh,

126
00:09:10.230 --> 00:09:14.280
sparkle, uh, or the triple store with the sparkle endpoint.

127
00:09:14.580 --> 00:09:17.800
The triple store is the same Apache chain of Zeki server,

128
00:09:18.210 --> 00:09:22.640
which I asked you to install on your local machines. Um,

129
00:09:24.060 --> 00:09:28.120
and, uh, they are connected, uh, via rest, uh,

130
00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:32.480
a p i, um, a p i. And, um,

131
00:09:32.630 --> 00:09:36.800
then the middle tier, uh, the application tier, um,

132
00:09:37.870 --> 00:09:41.160
they implies, uh, the business logic.

133
00:09:41.380 --> 00:09:44.360
It is programmed with the help of P H P.

134
00:09:45.180 --> 00:09:48.880
And if you are interested in, you can look up the code, uh,

135
00:09:48.980 --> 00:09:53.240
on our GitHub site. And, uh, finally, uh,

136
00:09:53.380 --> 00:09:57.120
the presentation tier is the web interface.

137
00:09:57.380 --> 00:10:00.840
And the web interface can also be, um,

138
00:10:02.480 --> 00:10:06.800
assessed via the, uh, link you see here. Unfortunately,

139
00:10:07.390 --> 00:10:11.240
this, uh, application is on one of our, um,

140
00:10:11.970 --> 00:10:15.840
university, um, service. And, um,

141
00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:21.520
sometime is it, it is, um, accessible, sometimes not. So yeah,

142
00:10:21.690 --> 00:10:25.680
maybe you try and it'll not work, but I hope today it'll work.

143
00:10:27.550 --> 00:10:31.040
Okay. What you see here is the,

144
00:10:32.420 --> 00:10:34.200
uh, the start page, uh,

145
00:10:34.380 --> 00:10:38.560
of our application and a detailed page,

146
00:10:38.940 --> 00:10:43.200
but I will switch to the application itself to,

147
00:10:43.860 --> 00:10:47.680
uh, show it here in more detail.

148
00:10:49.040 --> 00:10:49.873
I think it's here.

149
00:10:54.960 --> 00:10:57.250
Okay, so you can see it here.

150
00:10:57.950 --> 00:11:02.010
The application is now in two languages accessible.

151
00:11:02.010 --> 00:11:06.890
You can change here, um, between English and German.

152
00:11:07.370 --> 00:11:12.130
I at the moment have, uh, chosen, uh, English language.

153
00:11:12.230 --> 00:11:16.570
You can see here the, um, nine, no, not nine,

154
00:11:16.580 --> 00:11:21.090
eight categories, which we all already saw in our, uh,

155
00:11:21.290 --> 00:11:25.570
graph diagram. And, uh, you can see which, uh,

156
00:11:25.570 --> 00:11:29.170
number of services you have in each category. For instance,

157
00:11:29.540 --> 00:11:34.530
let's take the teaching platform services. There are three, uh,

158
00:11:34.530 --> 00:11:37.450
service, you can go in depth in that service.

159
00:11:37.550 --> 00:11:42.090
And then you see all the available, uh,

160
00:11:42.480 --> 00:11:45.790
educational services. Uh,

161
00:11:46.290 --> 00:11:50.630
and what is the most usable is the teaching platform

162
00:11:50.890 --> 00:11:54.240
Moodle. And when you click here, then you get, uh,

163
00:11:54.340 --> 00:11:56.280
the profile of that service.

164
00:11:56.940 --> 00:12:01.840
You can see again the name of the service. You can, uh,

165
00:12:01.910 --> 00:12:06.240
here, um, get information in which, uh,

166
00:12:06.680 --> 00:12:10.960
category, uh, or or to which other, um, no,

167
00:12:11.110 --> 00:12:15.690
wait a moment. Yeah. Uh, to which category it, um,

168
00:12:17.270 --> 00:12:22.250
uh, in, in which category it is. Um, yeah, put, so, uh,

169
00:12:22.310 --> 00:12:27.090
you can see that the teaching platform, we, um, opened it as, uh,

170
00:12:27.410 --> 00:12:28.410
teaching platforms,

171
00:12:28.830 --> 00:12:33.690
but it's also part of the element of the information

172
00:12:34.050 --> 00:12:37.930
services. So we have no, um, no,

173
00:12:38.300 --> 00:12:42.850
let's say total, uh, uniformity or total identity with,

174
00:12:43.110 --> 00:12:47.410
um, um, with respect to the service category.

175
00:12:48.750 --> 00:12:52.970
Um, here on the top, you can see the status of the service.

176
00:12:53.280 --> 00:12:56.930
This service is in operation. We have all,

177
00:12:57.230 --> 00:12:58.770
in all five, uh,

178
00:12:58.770 --> 00:13:03.210
different statuses from planning to implementation in

179
00:13:03.280 --> 00:13:08.210
operation, in relief and shutdown. Then,

180
00:13:08.210 --> 00:13:13.130
then you get, uh, some, uh, information description of the service. If, uh,

181
00:13:14.050 --> 00:13:18.690
possible you get an U R L, you can see here which,

182
00:13:18.990 --> 00:13:23.570
uh, other services are connected. Um, with that,

183
00:13:23.760 --> 00:13:28.130
yeah, are in relation. Relevant, I think is not really,

184
00:13:28.590 --> 00:13:32.890
um, correct, it not, it must be related services,

185
00:13:33.030 --> 00:13:34.690
not relevant, but related services.

186
00:13:36.910 --> 00:13:39.250
And then you see some contact information,

187
00:13:39.250 --> 00:13:43.810
which might be interesting if you have some problems with the service to, um,

188
00:13:44.560 --> 00:13:46.050
contact, uh, uh,

189
00:13:46.690 --> 00:13:49.650
a concrete person or a concrete organization.

190
00:13:50.390 --> 00:13:55.170
We also thought it might be a good idea to have a direct link to a

191
00:13:55.170 --> 00:13:57.730
service desk. And, uh,

192
00:13:57.990 --> 00:14:02.890
you can also get information about a service features for whom,

193
00:14:03.510 --> 00:14:08.410
um, they are available and which devices are supported.

194
00:14:08.750 --> 00:14:13.650
And, uh, also about the characteristics or the rating of the service, um,

195
00:14:13.740 --> 00:14:17.970
about the criticality and the priority and what's interesting.

196
00:14:18.070 --> 00:14:20.890
And what does the specific, um, um,

197
00:14:20.890 --> 00:14:25.250
characteristic or specific feature of such, uh, knowledge graph based, um,

198
00:14:25.290 --> 00:14:28.450
applications is that all of the,

199
00:14:29.670 --> 00:14:32.610
all of the characteristics, the information,

200
00:14:32.840 --> 00:14:36.130
what you get about the services, they are, uh,

201
00:14:36.130 --> 00:14:41.130
organized or they works as links. So for instance, when you see here that,

202
00:14:41.230 --> 00:14:44.690
uh, the data center is responsible for that service,

203
00:14:45.230 --> 00:14:47.210
and I click on that link,

204
00:14:47.320 --> 00:14:52.000
then I will get a list of all services for which the data

205
00:14:52.020 --> 00:14:53.440
center is responsible,

206
00:14:53.860 --> 00:14:58.840
or even if I click on the person which is responsible for that concrete service,

207
00:14:59.190 --> 00:15:02.640
then I will get a le list of services for, um,

208
00:15:03.460 --> 00:15:08.400
for which these, this person is available. Here you have, uh, this, um,

209
00:15:08.830 --> 00:15:13.200
information, um, buttons or the,

210
00:15:13.300 --> 00:15:17.720
the info buttons, and you can get here the, um,

211
00:15:18.080 --> 00:15:21.120
descriptions or comments, which are, um,

212
00:15:21.210 --> 00:15:25.440
which explains a little bit what, uh, everything means here.

213
00:15:25.620 --> 00:15:30.240
And this is also taken from the knowledge graph. That information,

214
00:15:31.060 --> 00:15:33.400
the same applies to this aspect,

215
00:15:33.470 --> 00:15:38.160
high criticality or high priority. When I click here,

216
00:15:38.600 --> 00:15:43.600
I, I will just do it, uh, for in a moment. Then you get, again, a list of, uh,

217
00:15:43.660 --> 00:15:48.400
all services which are of high criticality or even high,

218
00:15:48.620 --> 00:15:52.520
um, um, priority. The same comes to here,

219
00:15:52.700 --> 00:15:57.600
all these related services. You can click on related services and get direct,

220
00:15:57.900 --> 00:16:02.200
uh, to that service. Yeah. And, um, yeah,

221
00:16:02.250 --> 00:16:06.040
let's take one of that links when I click here on students.

222
00:16:06.510 --> 00:16:11.200
Then I get, as I, uh, promised you a list, you,

223
00:16:11.260 --> 00:16:14.360
you come to a search site where you get all the lists,

224
00:16:14.360 --> 00:16:16.480
which are available for students.

225
00:16:16.700 --> 00:16:20.960
And you can also proceed here in a direct, um,

226
00:16:22.180 --> 00:16:26.440
how it's called, uh, in navigation about, uh, different categories.

227
00:16:26.780 --> 00:16:28.880
And you see here, for instance,

228
00:16:28.900 --> 00:16:32.560
the different providers we have for the different services,

229
00:16:32.820 --> 00:16:37.520
and you see also how many services, uh, these providers are,

230
00:16:37.900 --> 00:16:42.360
um, accountable for and so on and so on. So this is, um,

231
00:16:43.020 --> 00:16:48.000
the, the application, ah, let's look here at this, um,

232
00:16:49.140 --> 00:16:53.040
at this, um, menu bar here you have, uh, other,

233
00:16:54.350 --> 00:16:58.880
yeah, features accessible. Um, for instance,

234
00:16:59.110 --> 00:17:03.680
this funny map where all the relations between the services

235
00:17:04.060 --> 00:17:08.880
are visualized with this, uh, connection map or again,

236
00:17:08.940 --> 00:17:12.720
you can go to reports and then you can, um,

237
00:17:14.640 --> 00:17:19.040
concrete reports, um, yeah, access these reports,

238
00:17:19.620 --> 00:17:23.120
for instance, uh, services for employees and so on and so on.

239
00:17:23.120 --> 00:17:27.080
So it's more or less the same we already saw, uh,

240
00:17:27.140 --> 00:17:31.760
by clicking on the different links, but in a little bit other,

241
00:17:32.140 --> 00:17:36.200
um, in another interface put. Okay,

242
00:17:40.400 --> 00:17:42.620
so thank you for that introduction.
